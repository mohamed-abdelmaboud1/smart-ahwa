# Smart Ahwa Manager - SOLID Principles & OOP Implementation

## Overview

Smart Ahwa Manager is a Flutter application that demonstrates the practical implementation of SOLID principles and Object-Oriented Programming concepts in a real-world coffee shop management system. The app reuses existing UI components while applying clean architecture patterns and design principles.

## SOLID Principles Applied

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

Each class has a single, well-defined responsibility:

**Models/Entities:**

- `Customer` - Manages only customer data representation
- `DrinkType` - Handles only drink type information and categorization
- `Order` - Manages only order-related data and state transitions
- `OrderItem` - Handles only individual order item data

**Services:**

- `OrderService` - Handles only order-related business logic
- `ReportService` - Manages only reporting and analytics operations
- `NotificationService` - Handles only notification delivery

**State Management:**

- `OrdersCubit` - Manages only order-related UI state
- `ReportsCubit` - Handles only reports-related UI state
- `SmartAhwaNavCubit` - Manages only navigation state

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

The system is designed to be open for extension but closed for modification:

**Service Implementations:**

- Different data storage solutions can be implemented via `OrderRepository` interface
- New report types can be added without modifying existing `ReportService` implementations

**UI Components:**

- `SmartAhwaBottomNav` extends the existing navigation pattern without modifying original `CafeBottomNav`
- New order status types can be added to the `OrderStatus` enum without breaking existing functionality

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Abstract interfaces can be replaced with any concrete implementation:

- Any implementation of `OrderRepository` can replace `InMemoryOrderRepository`
- Different report service implementations maintain the same interface contract

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

Interfaces are focused and contain only relevant methods:

- `OrderService` contains only order management methods
- `ReportService` focuses solely on analytics and reporting
- No client is forced to depend on methods it doesn't use

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concretions:

**Service Layer:**

- `OrderServiceImpl` depends on `OrderRepository` interface, not concrete implementation
- `ReportServiceImpl` depends on abstract `OrderRepository`
- Services are injected through constructor dependency injection

**Presentation Layer:**

- Cubits depend on service interfaces, not implementations
- UI components depend on cubit abstractions for state management

## Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

### 1. Encapsulation

**Data Protection:**

- Private fields with controlled access through getters/setters
- Internal state management in cubits and services
- Validation logic encapsulated within service methods

### 2. Inheritance

**Hierarchical Relationships:**

- All state classes extend from base cubit states
- Widget hierarchy follows Flutter's inheritance model
- Service implementations inherit from abstract interfaces

### 3. Polymorphism

**Interface-Based Polymorphism:**

- Different repository implementations (In-memory, database, API-based)
- Service layer can work with any implementation that follows the contract

### 4. Abstraction

**Service Abstractions:**

- Abstract service interfaces hide implementation complexity
- Repository pattern abstracts data access details
- State management abstracts UI complexity from business logic
